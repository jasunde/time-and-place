# Time and Place

A data visualization of crime reporting in Chicago.

This project generates a [choropleth map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) based on the caparative intensity of crime reporting between areas of Chicago with adjustable date and location granularity.

The project is build with the MEAN stack:
- MongoDB
- Express
- AngularJS
- Node.js

The crime report data comes from the City of Chicago's API: [Crimes - 2001 to Present](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofchicago.org/6zsd-86xi).

The map is drawn with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
